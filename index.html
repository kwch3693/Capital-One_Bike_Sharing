<h2 style="text-align: center;">LA Bike Sharing Data Visalization</h2>
<p>This is a change</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.
